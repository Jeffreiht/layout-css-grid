                <p>
                    Association football, commonly known as football or soccer, is a sport 
                    played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played 
                    by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world’s most popular sport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms 
                    while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. And now, it also holds its place 
                    among the richest sports in the world in 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soccer enjoys the most number of fans in almost all regions of the world. The number of people 
                    who follow the sport regularly and watch its global as well as regional competitions is unmatched.

                    Tokyo; city of flashing neon lights, super-advanced gadgetry, Hello Kitty 
                    and about 13 million people, which makes it one of the most densely populated 
                    cities in the world. But it’s got more to offer than batteries, bodies and blinking lights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the cacophony of sights, sounds and smells that is Tokyo.

                    it is possible to make a short journey and find yourself atop a mountain with nothing other 
                    than peace and tranquillity surrounding you.

                    Art fact: Eileen Agar, who took this photo at London Zoo, is an Argentine-born 
                    British artist. When she was young she travelled from Argentina to Britain with a 
                    cow and an orchestra.

                    because her mum thought that milk and good music were needed for a happy life.

                <p>
                    She was the first female surrealist and experimented with new ways of making art and new materials.
